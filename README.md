# GroupMessageRenamer

Allows you to rename any group message in iOS 14.  Long press on a message thread and press Change Group Name to rename it.  To remove the group name, leave it blank.

Note that every time you change the group name it will display "You named the conversation _____" in the thread as it does with group iMessages.<br>
If the group recipients are all iMessage recipients, they will get the notification of the new name and their group message name will change as if you did it from the info menu.<br>
If the group recipients are a mix of iMessage and non-iMessage users (MMS), no one will get a notification of the name change, including iMessage users on the thread.
